## Contribution Guidelines

Crusta X is built primarily using Qt5 with some CSS and Javascript, so if
you are comfortable in these languages just fork the repo and start hacking.

### Build Instructions

To build Crusta, you need Qt5 >= 5.10 installed. Then execute the following 
commands:

- `mkdir _build`
- `cd _build`
- `qmake ..`
- `make -j \`nproc\``

To install Crusta on linux you may optionally run `sudo make install` - this 
will enable you to run Crusta directly from the terminal by typing `crusta` 
and will also create entry in applications.
